                "  SACRAMENTO \u2013 California Attorney General Xavier Becerra today announced a $213,167 settlement against Grass Advantage, also known as Amazing Grass, a company based in Newport Beach, California, marketed as a nutrition company specializing in organic food supplements, greens, and protein powders. The settlement resolves allegations that Amazing Grass sold and distributed thirteen products containing excessive levels of lead or cadmium in violation of California\u2019s Proposition 65 law. As required by the law, businesses must provide a warning before exposing consumers to chemicals known to cause reproductive harm or cancer. However, the complaint alleges Amazing Grass failed to provide such warnings, and the company even touted the ability of the products to remove metals from the body. These toxic metals can cause severe and chronic health effects, including neurological impairments. Children and pregnant or nursing women are the most vulnerable to lead exposure, and recent studies demonstrate that lead can damage the human nervous system at even lower levels than previously believed. Children who are exposed to lead may suffer cognitive impairment, slowed body growth, and hearing damage, among other developmental harms. The Attorney General also alleged that Amazing Grass violated California\u2019s False Advertising Law by making or causing others to make untrue or misleading statements to induce consumers to purchase their products, as well as the Unfair Competition Law.",
                "  Tastes bad, just like all other greens. But let's be honest..... If you want to condense all your daily servings of greens into one powder, it's going to taste like you shoved your head into a lawn mower. Just pound it and call it good.",
                "  This is really awesome. I had some reservations at first because of a few negative comments. I don't know which version others bought but I really like the digest and detox formula. It is by no means highly sweetened. It has a pleasant taste without being too sweet. It is also very potent. I take one scoop in the morning and one in the evening and that's it. It does give energy, but it also makes your body feel like it's ridding itself of toxins. I can't say that this product in particular helped with weight loss, but I loss 10 pounds in 4 weeks using this with light exercise. However, I must point out that I also have PCOS and so I've also been using D-chiro and Myo-inositol but I used them for months without weight loss. I have also been using V8 vegetable juice and avoiding sugar, gluten and fast food restaurants. I try to eat lean meats, veggies, rice, eggs, fish, etc. I just wanted to be transparent because I can't say this ALONE caused weight loss, but it seemed to certainly help.",
                "  My body was terribly acidic to where I couldn't bear the taste of most vegetables and fruits (at least those that were alkaline).  My first couple weeks drinking this stuff was a little hard since my body was so acidic.  I had never tasted anything so bad.  Most of the time I was pinching my nose and throwing this to the back of my throat just to get through.  After those couple weeks though I started to notice a huge change.  Not only did the taste start to become sweet (rather than sour), I began to enjoy it.  Only a short time later did I notice that those vegetables and fruits I actively avoided and hated, were suddenly tasting pretty good!  IMO this stuff does its job very well!",
                "  I don\u2019t know why everyone complains about the container being half way empty. If you weigh it yourself you\u2019ll find the product has accurate info. LOVE this product so much i had to buy the larger size. My husband, daughter and I have IBS and multiple sensitivities to different foods and this has cured us of our awful symptoms. We can eat pizza and pasta again without feeling like death!!",
                "  Need it to detox badly. I bought this product from elsewhere but because I get all my supplements from Amazon I ordered and this powder is like Drano for the body. Going to the bathroom 4 times a day . No diarrhea issues. I take one scoop with 4 oz of grapejuice or green tea and 4oz of filtered water 30 m before breakfast every day. I will take for 2 weeks and rest one and then again. I don't know about the reviews about the strength of the formula now, all I know is that it works for me. Also it has an strong taste because of all the veg and fruits formula but I don't care, I careabout results. Lost 2.50 pounds on 7 days. Thanks to the company and to Amazon.",
                "  I realize this product may have previously included B12, Niacin and other minerals/vitamins, my review and rating are based on the positive effects this product has on my digestive system and what I can tell is a positive experience for my gut and digestive system.If you are looking for a top notch probiotic supplement that is absorbed better than capsules, along with the alkanizing and detoxification benefits this particular product provides, at a price under $20, I would absolutely recommend this.",
                "  Misleading description on website. The ingredients listed on the website are not what you get when you order. They have removed or reduced many of the ingredients. Listen to the other reviews\u200b regarding this. They are correct. Total waste. Did not perform as advertised. There are much better products.",
                "  If you want a detox product I highly suggest trying the DETOX & DIGEST instead of the ALKALIZE & DETOX (which has a stronger flavor and is more bitter). Adding the juice of one lemon makes the DETOX AND DIGEST more palatable as well.Neither tastes good per say, you definitely have to be ok w green drinks! But the fresh lemon juice makes it a more pleasant experience. Oh, I also drink out of a glass straw which helps too!",
                "  I have used this product for about a year now. It has cleared up acne cysts that kept appearing on my chin. Nothing else I tried helped this.  It took a few months for it to work-but work it did!  People constantly compliment me on my beautiful skin - even with no makeup.  I'm over 70 years old and this stuff makes me feel and look great! Even if I over-indulge in sugar and unhealthy foods, this drink prevents bad effects. My hair even seems healthier and thicker. I won't live without it."
