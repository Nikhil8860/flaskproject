            "  I purchased both the 6-outlet and 6-outlet/2 USB port, models. The first one arrived broken. It charged but the blue light did not come on indicating it was not actually providing any surge protection. The second model unfortunately broke in one day. The outlet used started to melt and the back of the device was cracked. SO basically, two fire hazards that made my outlets more dangerous than before! Given that two separate devices were defective, I would avoid choosing this product.For what it is worth, I have also purchased the Amazon models and they work fine.",
            "  Almost burnt my house down, as many other reviews stated, this thing is not safe. I plugged in just about 4 things and it started to smell like something was burning. I pulled it out of the outlet FAST! Good thing I did or my house would be gone and my cats would be dead. UNSAFE!!!",
            "  This has 6 outlets, however I could only use 4. None of the cords I plugged in would fit in an adjoining socket. It was also extremely loose fitting in the wall plug. Additionally, this will not fit into the wall mount plugs that stop surges (don't know what their called). Maybe it's just the plugs in my house, but it just didn't work for me. If you buy this for 6 extra outlets, keep looking - if you only need 4, this might work for you.",
            "  How hard is it to just plug in a surge protector?  With this??  Someone in QC totally screwed up a typical plugs measurements.  The metal make ends work and fit right in, but the plastic single male prong to hold the unit stable is off by about a 1/16 of an inch.  So the plastic prong snapped off, and I had to use a vacuum to suck out the the broken end from the receptacle.  So.  The house was built in 2009.  All receptacles and GFI\u2019s are up to code.  So please tell me the excuse.Find another reputable company that knows how to take proper measurements before they create their own products because these people don\u2019t.",
            "  Great multi-plug!! I needed a multi-plug surge protector for my kitchen and livingroom. I was extremely happy when these arrived! There is plenty of space between the 2 sections of the 3 plug areas and they look great on the wall!",
            "  It works as intended, and its holds up to 6 devices which is great.Down side is that if you unplug anything the whole unit tends to unplug off the wall with it. We use it in the kitchen to charge all my families devices and when ever someone takes the charger off the wall the whole unit tends to come with it. Luckily nothing is plugged in it that needs to be on at all times but still a problem.",
            "  I needed a surge protector for our utility closet. However the outlet is so close to the wall/ door frame that none of the other surge protectors fit. Then I saw this Philips 6 outlet surge protector. With it's curved design it fit perfectly on the awkward outlet location.And with it's 900 jules of protection, it's perfect to protect our dyson vacuum, drill and battery charger.It's not screwed into the outlet like other brands but if I'm not going to be unplugging these devices often at all. It plugs securely in the outlet. Highly recommended.",
            "  I like the thin profile, when I tried to plug in appliances, it was pretty difficult to get them to go all the way in, and pulling them back out pulls out the surge protector as well. Maybe after some good use it will loosen up a bit. I like the blue light instead of most red and green lights on traditional surge protectors. Nice and sleek, very modern.",
            "  DONT USE THESE ON ANYTHING BESIDES PHONES OR LOW POWER DEVICES. I bought these to use since where i live its been storming a lot and i figured some peace of mind would be great but i was wrong. within a couple of weeks one of them shorted out and killed some of my aquarium equipment that i had plugged into it. no biggie i thought ill just call up customer support and file a claim to get it replaced. I was wrong, they said it clearly states on the packaging not to use around aquariums since the moisture could damage them or cause them to fail. Lastly my only complaint with them besides the crappy coverage is the fact that they don't plug into the wall and stay plugged in since they aren't flush with the wall.; they curved back causes them to sag a little and come unplugged after a while if you have any heavy charging bricks or larger chargers plugged into them.",
            "  I am trying to clear up some cord clutter from my new work from home office setup now that I'm nice and settled in, so I wanted to replace my traditional power strip with something more compact and better for cable management. This one was at a good price point with good ratings. I've got my monitor, laptop, and speakers hooked up to it and it definitely reduced cord clutter. It's compact to the wall and not too visually intrusive, other than the (dim) blue surge protection indicator light. I also am more confident that it can support all three devices electricity-wise vs something smaller and slightly cheaper.This unit secures itself to the second outlet via a plastic pin that inserts itself into the ground of the second outlet. Many others I've seen used a screw through the unit into the screw hole on your wall plate and since I live in an apartment I didn't want to go that route just in case I somehow messed something up. So I like the plastic pin solution to steady it a little. However, it feels like if I were to try and unplug one of my cables it would pull the entire unit off from the outlet. It can rock a little from side to side when I plug something in, probably because my outlets stick out a little from the wall plate. So I just have to be careful when plugging in or unplugging something.Overall it does its job at a great price point, so if you are looking for a more compact power strip alternative this is a great option."
