            "  This plant based protein cannot be beat.  I have tried them all.  This is my third tub and I swear by this food.  I have never felt better in my entire life. I mix my cold brew coffee (8 oz) with Almond/hemp/cashew milk (3 oz) and a scoop of this protein.  I'm good for about 3 hours, no fatigue, no hunger.",
            "  Can't stand the Stevia taste like diet junk. I am sorry it's just my opinion they should not have change the original formula. They easily could have used maple sugar. Or kept it Unsweetened. Since many of us put fruit in there that will add its own sweetness. Hello",
            "  I LOVE this protein superfood!!!!I use it as a meal replacement at lunch and I\u2019m full for hours when it\u2019s mixed with almond milk! It tastes better than ANY protein powder I\u2019ve used. I\u2019ve started feelin by far more energy than I have in a loooong time. This is a powerful and proactive product that resonates with my body. I\u2019ll be recommending to EVERYONE !HOWEVER..... I bought the 28 day supply which was delivered April 10th. Today is May 2nd and I have MAYBE 2 doses left. And I didn\u2019t even use it everyday! And loose scoops not even to the top.THIS IS NOT A 28 DAY SUPPLY !!!!!!!!!!!",
            "  Many brands of protein powders were tested by Consumer Reports and the Environmental Working Group (EWG), and most were found to contain heavy metals.  Unfortunately, the worst offenders were those made from plant based protein. CR and EWG did not test this specific brand so it's unknown whether it contains heavy metals, and if so, in what quantity or concentration.  In the Amazon Questions Section,  the manufacturer says they test for heavy metals and comply with California Law, but do not give further information, or where to find it.",
            "  I had been using a proprietary protein/superfood powder from the cross-train gym that I attend.  I thought it was fabulous but too expensive to buy for use on a daily basis @ $30 for a 10-day supply.  So I'm experimenting with trying to recreate that product as best I can on a cheaper scale.  I was drawn to this powder because it contained nearly the same blend of plant-based protein I was looking for, along with a number of superfoods I had also wanted to see included.  The two ingredients I had been looking for that were missing were Maca root and Moringa leaf.  So I purchased separate packages of those powders, along with this Amazing Grass Protein Superfood Powder in the Rich Chocolate flavor.  The protein powder from my gym that I am used to contained some cacao but absolutely no sweetener.  I would mix that powder in with 1 cup of unsweetened almond milk, 1 banana, and 1/2 cup of frozen mixed berries.  So my sweetness would come from the banana primarily.  However, I noted that the Amazing Grass blend listed a sweetener (Stevia) as one of its ingredients.  I would have preferred an unsweetened/unflavored variety, but unfortunately the unfavored option only came in a smaller, 12 oz size.  I really wanted the largest size, both for economics reasons and so that I wouldn't have to repurchase the product so quickly.  The only variety that came in the larger 22.9 oz size was the chocolate flavor, so I decided to give it a try.I made my first shake today using the Amazing Grass powder and my other two supplements and the same recipe I've always used with the banana, etc.  My first taste I was hit with the sweetness of the shake.  It tasted so incredibly sweet to me as to make it almost unpleasant.  I'm just not used to that level of sweetness in a protein shake.  However, I experimented with adding about a 1/2 cup of water and when I tasted it again, it was significantly better and much more drinkable, along with being less thick.  So that will be my recipe going forward.  When I run out of the chocolate (in 17 days), I am going to buy the original unsweetened/unflavored variety in the smaller size just to compare the taste and sweetness level, and then decide after that which variety I prefer.For people who eat a lot of sweet things or processed foods, you may love the sweetness level of the chocolate powder and think I'm crazy for complaining that it is too sweet.  But for people like me who generally eat very clean and avoid sugars and sweets for the most part, and/or those who are used to unsweetened/unflavored protein mixes, I believe you would find this flavor to be a bit too sweet without watering it down somewhat.",
            "  One glance at the protein content, nutritional facts, and ingredients list was all I needed to be convinced this was a healthy way to replace meals but one sip of this chocolatey delight was all I needed to be obsessed.I do IF so I skip breakfast and usually consume this around noon. Combine one scoop and 16oz of unsweetened vanilla coconut milk in my shaker bottle, do a little shake shake dance break, and it's ready to go. Perfect consistency, smooth, and very filling. *If you let it sit for a while it does thicken up a lot of you're into that thick ice cream shake vibe*The first thing you'll notice after just one shake is how much better you feel. Your body is receiving all the nutrients it lacks in your (sometimes) crappy diet, so it rewards you by making you feel awesome \ud83d\ude0a.Also... Um, how the heck do you get so many superfoods to taste nothing like a big kale salad? I have no idea and I'm totally ok assuming that some type of black magic was performed in order to concoct this little piece of heaven.",
            "  I loathe fake sugars and fake tastes. This is a great base for a smoothie. I would NOT drink it plain (a little plant-y), but with a bit of fruit, it's fabulous. It's so hard to find a protein shake that's not flavored. This is it!",
            "  I love this Amazing Grass Original simple because it does NOT have the stevia sweetner in it, like all their other protein products. The only real draw back is the extreme cost of this.  Ends up being $50 for same amount as their Protein with stevia, in large size..  at $34.  So weight the difference in cost verses taste. Why this stevia thing has taken the market must be same as why palm oil has crawled right back into every snack and food product in the world. It is CHEAP to use. Saves the companies Moooooooneeeeeeey!  ( as Kevin 'the cold hearted capitalist' O'Leary would say).",
            "  I want a powder that is sourced only from the USA. The ingredients in here are sourced from around the world. Goji could be from China. I tried this 4 days and it gave me a headache each time and also some trouble sleeping! The detox and digest one gave me a tight sore throat-so only used that 1 day. Threw them both out-afraid of allergic reaction possibly from dandelion root which is connected to ragweed, and the other one too-because I love good sleep!",
            "  After a diet analysis, I realized I wasn't getting enough protein and I thought this would be an easy fix. Now I am hooked.I first purchased this product at a local grocery store and after finishing my first container, I accidentally purchased the wrong brand - the Marky Mark brand, VEGA, the containers are similar - and I didn't realize right away - I just thought my taste buds were off. I like to use protein powder in my baking as well, and when my baked goods overwhelmingly tasted like the off brand, it was so obvious that I haven't been able to bring myself to finish the  container and I had to throw out the baked goods. I have since found the original product here on Amazon and gone through 5 containers in less than a year.As for flavor: It does have a taste to it - but it's nowhere close to typical whey formula aftertaste - I would say it's even better than the muscle milk aftertaste and I really like muscle milk. I have only tried the vanilla flavor - because it is so delicious that I am worried I would be disappointed in any other flavor. And \"if it ain't broke...\"I usually mix it with milk - and when I use chocolate cow's milk, it tastes like a Wendy's Frosty and it's relatively thick like a typical protein shake. It's not quite as sweet with chocolate almond milk and the consistency is not as thick either. I have JUST used it with water and I would say that it doesn't taste like whey, but more like a spirulina/chlorella pill - which is STILL better than whey based protein shakes. I don't remember using it with any fruit smoothies but I'm thinking that it would be a welcome ingredient. As far as baking, I usually throw a scoop or two into whatever I am baking and I find that it does not change the taste whatsoever, unlike the VEGA brand.This product is organic, vegan and kosher. It has 20g protein per scoop. And is a painless way to increase protein in your diet. I would def. recommend this product to others, and will probably be a lifetime buyer."
